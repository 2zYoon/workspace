# Basic Rules
- separated by ":", we expect that there's something after ":"
- no whitespace except user-specified field
- user-specified field is only placed at the last and after ">"
	- ex: CLIENT:RES:PWD>asdf1234
- server do not trust client
	- do not change something according to the message
	- if server meets illegal format message, ignore and close the connection
